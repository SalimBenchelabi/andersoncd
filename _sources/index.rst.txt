extracd
=======

This is a library to run iterative regularization for convex bias. [1].

Installation
------------
First clone the repository available at https://github.com/mathurinm/andersoncd::

    $ git clone https://github.com/andersoncd.git
    $ cd andersoncd/


We recommend to use the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.

From a working environment, you can install the package with::

    $ pip install -e .

To check if everything worked fine, you can do::

    $ python -c 'import extracd'

and it should not give any error message.

From a Python shell you can just do::

    >>> import extracd

If you don't want to use Anaconda, you should still be able to install using `pip`.
